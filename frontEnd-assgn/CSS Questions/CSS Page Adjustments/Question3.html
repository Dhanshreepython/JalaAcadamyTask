     1. Easy Language

      Python is an easy language. It is easy to read, write, learn and understand.

      Python has a smooth learning curve. It is easy to learn.
      Python has a simple syntax and Python code is easy to understand.
      Since it’s easy to understand, you can easily read and understand someone else’s code.
      Python is also easy to write because of its simple syntax.
      Because it is an easy language, it is used in schools and universities to introduce students to programming.
      Python is for both startups and big companies.

      2. Readable
      The Python language is designed to make developers life easy. Reading a Python code is like reading an English
      sentence. This is one of the key reason that makes Python best for beginners.

      Python uses indentation instead of curly braces, unlike other programming languages. This makes the code look
      clean and easier to understand.

      3. Interpreted Language
      Python is an interpreted language. It comes with the IDLE (Interactive Development Environment). This is an
      interpreter and follows the REPL structure (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop). It executes and displays the output of one
      line at a time.

      So it displays errors while you’re running a line and displays the entire stack trace for the error.

      4. Dynamically-Typed Language
      Advertisement

      Python is not statically-typed like Java. You don’t need to declare data type while defining a variable. The
      interpreter determines this at runtime based on the types of the parts of the expression. This is easy for
      programmers but can create runtime errors.

      Python follows duck-typing. It means, “If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must
      be a duck.”

      5. Object-Oriented
      Python is object-oriented but supports both functional and object-oriented programming. Everything in Python is an
      object.

      It has the OOP (Object-oriented programming) concepts like inheritance and polymorphism.

      issubclass(str,object)
      6. Popular and Large Community Support
      Python has one of the largest communities on StackOverflow and Meetup. If you need help, the community will answer
      your questions.

      They also already have many answered questions about Python.

      you are working on projects.

      4. Learn Python 3 the Hard Way – by Zed A. Shaw
      Python Books

      Zed A. Shaw believes that “the hard way is easier!”.

      The book tries to make an engagement with the reader. It will seem hard at first. That’s because you will start
      learning python by solving 52 exercises throughout the course of this book.

      You get to learn from the vast variety of topics it covers under the fundamentals of python. And you get to make
      your first game and your very own website!


      So by the end of the book, you can definitely call yourself a “Python Programmer”.



      Python Books for Intermediate level
      These are the books to choose from when you already have the basic knowledge of python programming or any other
      programming language as such.

      1. Head First Python, 2nd edition – by Paul Barry
      Python Books

      It’s different from other books.

      This is what the publisher’s website has to say about the book, “Based on the latest research in cognitive science
      and learning theory, Head First Python uses a visually rich format to engage your mind, rather than a text-heavy
      approach that puts you to sleep.”

      Why waste your time struggling with new concepts?

      This multi-sensory learning experience is designed for the way your brain really works.” Unlike traditional books,
      this one has an eye-pleasing and engaging style.

      All the pretty pictures and repetitive context makes it interesting and easier to remember what you read earlier.

      Covers the basic concepts to begin with and slowly moves towards building a more advanced approach.

      2. Dive Into Python 3 – by Mark Pilgrim
      Python Books

      Already have programming experience in Python 2 but need to adapt to Python 3? This book is your hands-on guide.

      As Python 2 is going obsolete, many companies are expecting their employees to get familiar with working in Python
      3.

      This book is for :

      Those who are a complete beginner to programming.
      Those who have basic programming experience in other languages.
      The returning professionals who need to get back to coding
      The Python programmers switching from Python 2 to Python 3.

      3. Python 101 – by Michael Driscoll


      Python 101 starts off by going into detail about the fundamentals and then gradually builds up from there.


      Divided into five parts, the book in its entirety covers a considerate amount of intermediate level materials
      alongside the beginner materials.

      The different parts of the book separately incorporate the basic concepts, Python’s standard library, intermediate
      material, tutorials, and Python’s packages.

      The author has to say the following about the book,

      “It is not meant to be an exhaustive reference book. Instead, the object is to get you acquainted with the
      building blocks of Python so that you can actually write something useful yourself.”

      4. Python Tricks: The Book – by Dan Bader
      Python Books

      Dan Bader writes in his book,

      “Python Tricks started out as a short series of code screenshots that I shared on Twitter for a week. To my
      surprise, they got rave responses and were shared and retweeted for days on end.”

      This is how the book started, with simply a few tweets.

      It’s a series of shortcode snippets that apparently “discovers the hidden gold” of python standard libraries.

      This book will bring out the coolest aspects of python with short and easy examples. This book proves to be a

      This book showcases the abilities of Python in performing impactful scientific calculations. It exposes you to
      packages like NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy etc.

      This book also introduces you to new technologies like Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.

      The tests at the end of the book challenge you. It makes you recall the tools you used earlier in the book.

      Summary
      Learning python is easy and at the same time a never-ending process. The more you dig deeper, the more you come
      across the hidden aspects of the language. To really make an impact, you need to build a rigid foundation. A part
      of the recipe for this rigid foundation is marked by these books, the other part will be marked by you.</div>
